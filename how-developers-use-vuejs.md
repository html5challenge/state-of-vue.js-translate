## How developers use Vue.js

We were curious about the experience with Vue.js among software developers and Chief Technology Officers. In an online survey we asked them a number of questions to determine:

- what were the reasons behind adding Vue to their tech stack,
- what advantages did working with this framework offer them,
- what were their main doubts with regard to using Vue in their project,
- what resources did they use to master Vue.js,
- how many of their colleagues use Vue and whether they expect this number to grow in the next 12 months,
- for how long have they and their teams used Vue.js,
- what other backend and frontend technologies are used in those companies.

### Report Data

All report data comes from a survey conducted over a four-week period in August and September of 2017. We received 1,126 responses, mainly from software developers and Chief Technology Officers (94.1% of the respondents held these or related technical roles) whose organizations use Vue. The responses came in from every continent on Earth (except Antarctica); in total, we’ve managed to collect replies from 88 countries.

We also asked Evan You, Vue creator and Chris Fritz, Vue Core Team member to comment on some of the survey results, in order to provide additional insights or to share their broader perspective.

### Key Insights

- **96%** survey participants would use Vue.js again for their next project.
- **94%** of the respondents used the Official Vue documentation as their main source of knowledge about the framework.
- **81%** of survey participants say that ease of integration is one of the chief advantages of having Vue in their organizations’ tech stack.
- **54%** are convinced Vue.js is going to get more popular in their organization in the next 12 months.

### Survey Questions

#### What was the most important reason behind adding Vue.js to the technology stack?

Whether starting a new project or inheriting one—the developers are more or less unanimous: Vue.js is pretty easy to start with, even for a really complex applications. They appreciate its simplicity and architec- tural elegance, elaborate on how easy it is to integrate Vue, but also compare its lightness and performance to other popular frameworks, claiming Vue is the unquestionable winner here. All in all, **Vue.js is described as a beginner-friendly framework by more than half of the respondents.**

**THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON BEHIND ADDING VUE TO THE TECH STACK**

- Vue.js is pretty easy to start with 59%
- Tech stack needed to be updated 22%
- Team was interested in trying out the framework 10%
- Other 9%

> Could be used for existing and new projects + pretty easy to use! 
>
> From Chief of Technology Officer, Large enterprise, France.

> Easy to integrate with existing apps or go full SPA.
>
> Software developer, Medium enterprise, Australia.

#### What were the doubts you and your team had when planning to add Vue.js to your tech stack?

The respondents mention two main doubts they had when planning to add Vue.js to their tech stack. First concern, expressed by 45% of respondents, is more related to their teams themselves. **Lack of former Vue experience** among their colleagues was seen as a possible issue when planning to add the framework to their tech stack.

- Lack of former Vue.js experience among employees 45%
- Uncertainty regarding its future 45%
- Lack of a popular native mobile development platform 23%
- Doubts about its scalability 15%
- Other 12%

> Vue’s mobile options are constantly improving. In the meantime though, Vue offers very strong support for Progressive Web Apps, including a dedicated template. Community projects like Onsen UI even simplify the process of building native-like, hybrid UIs.
>
> From Chris Fritz, Vue.js core team member.

> We do have Weex and NativeScript, but we acknowledge they both have areas to improve. Weex has been used in production at Alibaba for quite a long time, and is essentially Alibaba’s bet in the mobile dev space. But it lacks in terms of documentation and learning resources for English speakers. We intend to bridge that gap next year by providing official guidance on how to get started with it from the Vue side.
>
> NativeScript is also a solid technology, and its integration with Vue, although relatively young, is being improved at a rapid pace. It’s getting more impressive every day. Definitely keep an eye on it if you are interested in using Vue for native development.
>
> From Evan You, Vue.js creator.

**Lack of a popular native development platform** was mentioned by the same percentage of respondents as their doubt when considering using Vue.js.

Doubts about Vue.js scalability were chosen by 172 survey participants, making it one of the five most prevalent doubts plaguing developers planning to add the framework to their current tech stack.

> Architectural-wise, Vue is built on the component-based model for UI development which is a proven pattern shared among all major frameworks, with solid official solutions for SPA routing and large-scale state management. It is designed for approachability, but is also designed with scale in mind.
> 
> We also have many users successfully building large scale projects with Vue, some even with hundreds of components and are still perfectly happy with the workflow. In addition, some existing big apps are being rewritten with Vue and we’ve received very positive feedback from devs working on them, for example Adobe Portfolio and JSFiddle.

#### What are the biggest advantages that Vue.js brings to your organization?

An impressive **81% of developers emphasize ease of integration** when it comes to Vue. The majority remarked upon how easy it is to master Vue and claimed that it’s much easier to learn than other popular frameworks. They also appreciate its **uncomplicated inte- gration with backend frameworks**.

Documentation is another strong point of Vue, brought up by 60% of surveyed developers. A similar number of respondents (56%) identified the framework’s performance as its biggest advantage.

> The smooth learning curve make a lot of people interested into Vue.js.
>
> From Senior developer, Medium-size business, New Zealand.

> We were debating React vs Vue and ultimately chose Vue and we are glad we did.
>
> Software developer, Medium enterprise, USA.

> Vue.js makes frontend development manageable and scalable. The learning curve is pretty easy so backend developers can easily get what’s going on without too much guidance. Since there are a lot of pretty good webpack configs already out there, it kinda feels like plug and play nowadays. Finally, the fact that we can use Vue.js either via run time or compiling it, it’s a pretty amazing tool to use from small to large applications without too much difficulty in scaling.

#### Is there anything you’re missing when it comes to Vue.js?

We received 481 valid responses to this open-ended question. Since some of the shortages were mentioned by more than 20 people, we decided to employ broader categories for them.

Lack of a native Vue mobile solution is one of the biggest pain points, spontaneously mentioned by more than 24% of respondents. There is definitely **a strong demand for a more advanced mobile solution for Vue.js**.

15% of those who replied to this question, identified a **relatively small ecosystem** as another Vue drawback. Once the ecosystem gets better and bigger it will be able to ensure a better collection of components. 

Additionally,

> **tooling is going to be improved even more with the next iteration of the CLI,** assures Evan You.

In their replies, respondents also brought up lack of official tutorials, a “Vue bible” as one of them called it, or a comprehensive Vue Cook- book that would offer more real life examples, especially in complex apps. As Christ Fritz comments,

> **The recently released [official style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) now provides a sort of Vue bible, but it was unavailable at the time of the survey.**

There is also a need for **better documentation for the framework** , since 53 of respondents mentioned some issues related to it either directly (eg. More architecture-related documentation regarding bigger apps ) or indirectly, mentioning some issues they wrongly assume are impossible to solve with Vue. The two final issues, identified by more over 20 respondents, were related to improvements in testing tools and the need to **improve the core**.

**SUGGESTIONS**

![](https://i.loli.net/2017/11/01/59f977f3035c6.png)

- Need of Vue-native, a more advanced mobile solution 116
- Bigger, better ecosystem, assuring better collection of components and tooling 74
- Official tutorials and other learning resources, providing more use cases with best practices and real life examples (esp. of complex apps) 67
- Better documentation allowing smoother apps development 53
- Better testing tools and libraries 37
- Improved core 21

> The cookbook, which will begin serious development in November, will help provide examples for larger apps, common integrations, and also explore architecture questions.
>
> From Chris Fritz

#### What’s the probability of you using Vue again for a new project?

More than **95% of respondents claim they would use Vue.js again for a new project**. A number that high clearly proves that their doubts went away once they gained experience with the framework. Even though they mention its shortages and express the need for improvements, Vue is clearly appreciated by almost everyone who has ever used it and the overwhelming majority of respondents have no doubts about using it again for their next project.

**THE PROBABILITY OF USING VUE FOR NEXT PROJECT**

#### What resources do you use to learn about Vue.js?

**The official Vue documentation is the most popular resource used to learn about Vue.js**. It was chosen by 94% of software developers, proving that a well thought out documentation is a major strength of any framework. Additionally, online articles, blog posts, and commu- nities such as StackOverflow or the official Vue Forum have been iden- tified as a source of knowledge by over 70% of the surveyed software de- velopers. Online courses have attracted 41% of them, while on-the-job training and books have served less than 1/4 of the respondents.
