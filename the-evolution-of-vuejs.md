## The Evolution of Vue.js

Did you know that when Vue was first released, it wasn’t even called “Vue”? The first commit, is dated back to June 27, 2013 and Vue was still called “Seed” at the time. That’s over 4 years
ago today. The first name stuck for nearly six months before it was eventually changed to Vue in early December of 2013. The first public release(0.8.0), however, was unveiled only in February of 2014. At the time, Vue was a library that only focused on the View layer of the MVC architectural paradigm.

There were several important aspects of Vue that made it “click” with developers. The template syntax followed a style similar to AngularJS and a component-based architecture introduced by React, thus creating a smooth bridge between the two mindsets. I like to think about
Vue as the lovely child that got the best parts of its parents, AngularJS and React, with a constant emphasis on developer experience and approachability.

The JavaScript community became increasingly interested in Vue, but it was a year later, when the Laravel community (gathered around this popular PHP framework) first discovered it that Vue really took off. A couple of months later, the long-awaited 1.0 version was finally released. This was a groundbreaking step for the library.

In the meantime, the community saw the release of vue-router(August 18th, 2015), vuex (November 28th, 2015) and vue-cli (December 27th, 2015). These libraries marked the transformation of Vue from a View-layer library into what we today call the Progressive Framework.

Last year, we’ve seen the release of the much-anticipated version 2.0—a complete rewrite of the framework which introduced several new concepts like the Virtual DOM and Server-Side Render-
ing capabilities. However, the API remained virtually unchanged, so the migration was smooth. The official vue-migration-helper tool helped the process, too.

### The Community

Fast forward one year and the still-thriving community has made Vue.js one of the top 3 most popular JavaScript frontend frameworks to date. And it doesn’t look like it’s going to stop there.

People fell in love with Vue. But rather than trust in our emotional assessment, take a look at the numbers—Vue was the most starred project on GitHub in 2016. Talk about developer enthusiasm!

The community interest is incredibly strong—when we launched the [Vue Newsletter](http://vue-newsletter.com/), hundreds of people subscribed in a matter of minutes. The never-ending stream of email notifications made us feel like Instagram stars. The first issue of the newsletter went to 759 subscribers. Sixty-three weekly issues later, our audience has grown to nearly 6, subscribers. Each new issue is harder to prepare because of how much
new Vue-related content surfaces basically every week now. High-quality tutorials, insightful articles, and all the libraries I could ever think of now tend to show up daily. It’s insane! And that’s not all—the Vue community is bolstered with a [thriving forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/) and a [Discord channel](https://chat.vuejs.org/), with thousands of developers active on both of these outlets each day.

Additionally, we can see that a growing number of companies across the globe are increasingly betting on Vue, following the rapidly growing interest of their developers. Just look at all the job offers published at [vuejobs.com](http://vuejobs.com/).

### The Ecosystem

I think it’s worth mentioning that apart from the community projects, the Vue Core Team also maintains several official libraries, such as vue-router, vuex (state management), vue-rx, and vuex-observable (for RxJS), as well as tools like vue-cli, vue-server-renderer, vue-loader, vetur, and vue-migration-helper. Why is this important, you ask? Because it allows you to progressively opt-in to use other core libraries that transform Vue into a full-fledged framework like Angular or Ember, with the guarantee that it will work seamlessly. However, you can always switch parts of it for other, unofficial solutions, if that is what your project requires. Another good thing about the official supporting libraries is that they always represent the highest quality and offer longterm support and compatibility with Vue itself.

As one would expect, a massive and highly involved community such as Vue’s comes with a significant number of community projects. And not just small, focused libraries, we’re talking large-scale projects here. For example, [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) is a highly-opinionated framework built on top of Vue that combines several smaller tools as well as patterns that make it incredibly easy to develop applications with SSR support.

There’s the [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org), which helps with the development
of hybrid mobile and desktop applications. There are also several very popular UI frameworks like [Element-UI](http://element.eleme.io/#/en-US) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) that will give you dozens of unified UI components to bootstrap your application. Vue also gets more and more support from mobile development frameworks like [OnsenUI](https://onsen.io/vue/) by Monaca and [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/a-new-vue-for-nativescript).

From my perspective as a Web applications developer, I can assure you — it already has everything your app will probably need. Each week I see more and more libraries being published, to the point that it’s impossible to keep track of all of them. Many of those libraries can be found here: [A list of awesome things related to Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue). Additionally, the core team manages a list of recommended libraries at [curated.vuejs.org](http://curated.vuejs.org/) for popular tasks like validations, i18n, AJAX requests, to help with the fatigue of picking the right tool.

### The Backing

Many people point out that Vue is not backed by any large company in the same way Angular or React are, and they act like it’s a bad thing. I dare to disagree. Vue truly embodies the spirit of open source, like jQuery, Babel or webpack do, and those are the most reliable tools
in the JavaScript world. There is a significant advantage in that. The project doesn’t have to follow the needs of a particular company and can instead focus on what the community needs.

And Vue does deliver what the community needs the most. When speaking about the support for code splitting, Sean Larkin, a core team member of webpack, described Vue as:

> The first framework to craft a Developer Experience with webpack in mind.

But the focus on developer experience goes far beyond webpack and is present in every aspect of the library, starting from its ease of use,through smooth integration, and up to top-notch documentation and overall scalability.

Obviously, Vue.js—again, like almost every other open-source library— began as a one-man project. Since then, it grew to the point where it has a fully-staffed core team that takes care of different aspects of the library and its ecosystem.

The funding? Over the last two years, individuals and companiesfrom all around the world decided to support Evan You (the creator) and the Core Team with a stable monthly income of more than $10, through successful campaigns on both Patreon and Open Collective. This allowed Evan to shift to working on Vue full time.

The sponsors include multiple companies and hundreds of other private backers. The list of current sponsors can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/support-vuejs/).

### The Growth

Here are some numbers that might give you a feeling of how fast the Vue ecosystem is growing.

Let’s take GitHub stars for example. Although they might not be the perfect metric to demonstrate the popularity of a project just yet, they surely show the excitement around it. And the excitement was high enough to make Vue the [Most Starred Project on GitHub in 2016](https://risingstars2016.js.org/#all). Not just within the JavaScript or frontend categories. It was the most starred project that year, period, and right now it’s the second most-starred frontend framework, sitting slightly behind React, and the sixth most-starred GitHub project overall. It already surpassed jQuery and Angular.

Surveys like the [State of JavaScript 2016](https://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) indicate that Vue has one of the highest satisfaction ratings and 89% of developers who’ve used Vue before would pick it again.

Naturally, there are a number of other metrics to check out, such as monthly npm downloads (~800k) or weekly dev tools users (~270k). The npm numbers might seem small compared to React, but it’s worth mentioning that Vue downloads increased more than five times over the last twelve months. Looking at the momentum Vue currently has, I believe it’s safe to assume the numbers will grow at an even greater pace in the coming years.

A big part of this growth comes from the fact that more and more com- panies are picking Vue as their main frontend framework. Among other things, these recent adopters have been praising Vue’s incredibly smooth learning curve, ease of integration into their existing stack, top-notch
performance, and—what’s probably the most important factor—the im- provements in development speed and reductions in maintenance costs. In other words, choosing Vue saves money.

But don’t take my word for it just yet. To make our case, we surveyed 1,126 developers from 88 countries, and collected several case studies, hailing from a range of different industries, that have adopted Vue.
