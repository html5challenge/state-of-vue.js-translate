## Preface

A few years back, Monterail was a well-established develop-ment agency, renowned for its Ruby and Rails expertise. Now, from today’s perspective, such a label feels a bit odd. We started with traditional Ruby multi-page app development, but pretty soon it became obvious to us that many of the practices and patterns changed as technologies evolved. Backbone.js was our first foray into JS frameworks in 2011, undertaken since we couldn’t just stay inert if we wanted to meet the market needs. We have been actively monitoring this dynamically changing world, and along the way we early-adopt- ed Angular JS and became experts on it. With the advent of the latest generation of component-based frameworks, our team has embraced all the major players in the field, including React (along with React Native), Angular (2 and up), and—most extensively—Vue.js.

### Familiar Does Not Mean Better

Before we started working with clients who requested an app written with Vue directly, we were talking to businesses who have never heard of it. Once they did, they were impressed with its openness and power, and wanted to include Vue in their technology stack.

We feel that most companies which choose more well-known frameworks make their decisions without having all the relevant informa- tion and simply adopt something that sounds familiar. They’re usually unaware that somewhere out there, there’s a technology which combines the advantages of Angular and React and adds an additional layer of niceness on top of it.

### The Rationale Behind the State of Vue.js Report

With Vue in our tech stack we can efficiently deliver better productsit helps us drive our business and make clients happy, and so we believe it deserves all attention and love. With that in mind, we embarked on the journey to evangelize to developers and businesses and spread
the word about Vue. That’s how we ended up curating the weekly Vue-newsletter, organizing VueConf, the first international Vue.js conference in the world, and creating libraries like Vuelidate and Vue-multiselect.

The report you’re reading is yet another milestone in that mission. It was created for three primary reasons. One, to provide a reliable source of Vue.js business use cases so anyone can get a sneak peek at how other companies use Vue.js. Two, to reach more individuals who have never heard of Vue and provide them with good reasons to give the framework a closer look. Three, to never, ever again have to convince our clients that Vue.js is a ready-to-use solution and has everything we need to build all kinds of applications.

### Contents of the Report

The **State of Vue.js** report offers a business owners’ and developers’ perspective on Vue. We surveyed over than 1,100 specialists from 88 countries to find out their experiences with Vue, and what they like and dislike about it most. We dug even deeper, and interviewed six companies on what problems they wanted to solve with Vue.js. To give you an overview of its growth over the years, we described the story of Vue.js, also including a sneak peek of what’s coming next from Evan You, the creator of the framework himself.

We would not be able to pull this report off if it weren’t for many amazing people who supported us along the way. They all were a tremendous help, sharing their knowledge and experiences, just because they wanted to give back to the community they’re part of.

Big thank you to Evan You, who was excited about the report from the very beginning and had our backs during the creation of this very piece of content. He also agreed to share invaluable insights about the future of Vue.js and supported our writing efforts.

Evan, as well as Chris Fritz, Vue.js core member, were insanely helpful with analyzing the State of Vue.js survey results. Kudos for that. Because of our collaboration, we felt comfortable about the quality of the final product.

The case study part of the report would never come into existence if it weren’t for all those who agreed to spend their time sharing their stories. The warmest thank yous to Jacob Schatz, Sylvain Simao, Roman Kuba, Gilles Bertaux, Scott O’Brien, Erin Depew, Matt O’Connell, and Yuriy Nemtsov.
