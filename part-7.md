**CHALLENGE**

Building reliable real-time webinar software from scratch and having it make an impact in a highly competitive market
Only a handful of Vue.js experts in Paris.
Attracting initial customers and validating the product idea.

**SOLUTION**

Building a quick MVP.
Using Vue.js and Ruby to create a high-performance app.
Appearing at Vue.js community meetups to seek out potential hires for the team.

**OUTCOME**

Instant positive feedback from customers.
Reusable components and fast development.
Rapidly growing business with 20-30% revenue growth month to month.

#### Challenge

Unlike other webinar platforms, Livestorm renders everything in the browser. The service provides actionable insights through analytics, integration with popular CRMs, and marketing automation software.

For an app like this, Gilles and his team had to pick a high-performance tech stack. Starting from scratch, they were intent on validating their idea and building a stable and reliable product.

> The backbone of Livestorm is a Rails app—everything in backend is made with Ruby. For all our frontend components we chose Vue.js, Gilles explains.

> We started working on our project in January of 2016 and from day one we knew we would be using Vue. We needed something that’s entirely open-source, highly performant, with a particular logic of components. Vue was the only framework that met all our requirements.

A startup created by four co-founders, Livestorm sought to assemble a robust staff from the company’s very beginning.

> We thought a lot about hiring. There were only a handful of Vue.js developers in the Paris area where we work. We also considered recruiting developers proficient in other frameworks similar in structure to Vue, but in that case the onboarding process itself could have taken much longer and that was problematic for us.

To build a successful live streaming product, the team had to focus on reliability.

> Reliability is a top priority for us. If you lose the live stream, webi- nars and demos crash and lose stream, our business basically makes no sense, Gilles says.

> If the app’s down or there’s a bug making it impossible to use, we lose customers. We needed a technology that would somehow both guarantee top code quality and run really fast. We’re still working on implementing end-to-end unit testing. Something we haven’t done yet with Vue, it’s completely new to us.

#### Solution

Most of developers still choose React and other popular frameworks, but Gilles believes there’s a shift coming.

> To hire experts for our staff, we attended Vue.js meetups in Paris, where we met highly experienced people. We also tried recruiting via job sites. Interestingly, most of the developers we spoke with said that they use Vue.js for their own side projects but their jobs have them working on a daily basis with Angular, React, and other frame- works. Often in big, well-established companies, Gilles points out.

> One thing I’ve noticed, however, that companies often use these technologies because they’re forced to by legacy code or because they want to get a taste of this new hot tech everyone else is trying out. In the startup community, on multiple Slack channels and meet- ups I’m part of, CTOs and co-founders I spoke with who were interested in moving towards Vue.js were very excited with the fact that we’ve chosen Vue at Livestorm and have been asking a lot of questions about it. Frankly, I believe there’s a significant shift coming—people will be more interested in moving towards something reliable and high performance, like Vue.js, while hyped technologies like React will gradually wane in popularity until they’re finally phased out, Gilles adds thoughtfully.

As Gilles wanted to put his product out there as quickly as possible, the team created a quick MVP to get some initial feedback from the outside world.

> We spent less than a month building the first MVP. It was enough to present the product and the basic concept. In the end, we got a lot of positive feedback, which confirmed that we have a market fit, he recalls.

> It took us 5 months to sell the first subscription. That’s quite long, but we needed to first work through some stuff that was not neces- sarily technology-related.

The list of features that Gilles’ team built into their platform to make it a competitive solution is really awe-inspiring.

> WebRTC real-time streaming, full HD streaming during live ses- sions, webcam and screen sharing are the primary video-related features. We also offer an analytics-focused section that runs on Vue. js and integration with popular sales and marketing tools like Salesforce. We also developed a one-of-a-kind feature that no other browser-based webinar software has, which allows users to switch, on-the-fly, from WebRTC to HLS to make the stream compatible with Internet Explorer users and a range of mobile devices.

#### Outcome

After a year on the market, Livestorm has customers from all over the globe and a profitable product.

> We have around 150 paying customers. They are all impressed with how fast Livestorm is, they also love the UI and UX. Business-wise, we have an app that runs on its own, without our interference, so to speak—we don’t have a sales team. We have a staff of seven, includ- ing product experts, engineers, and one marketing person. That would be me. But just because the product is that good and reliable, we grow by 20-30% each month, Gilles explains.

With Vue.js, Livestorm can release new features faster to the delight of their customers.

> We try to ship new things as fast as possible, of course. Right now, we’re two months into a phase that will conclude with the release of a big feature we’re working on, but we usually ship features in a week or two, Gilles elaborates.

> With Vue.js we don’t have to reinvent the wheel every single time.

> We can reuse all the components we already have to speed up the de- velopment. Currently, 39.5% of our our codebase is built with Vue.

Gilles claims that choosing Vue.js over other frameworks made his com-
pany succeed faster.

> Only benchmarks tell the truth and right now the benchmarks clearly demonstrate that Vue.js is definitely the choice for new and existing products. So if anyone has to make a technology choice in the near future, they should rely on concrete facts, figures, and benchmarks rather than opinions, he says.

> If you have a lot of developers on staff who are used to Angular or the more classic frameworks, having them shift to React may be painful for the entire team. Transitioning to Vue, on the other hand, is much smoother, which in turn translates to lower costs. We didn’t have to spend a month setting everything up like with Re- act, Vue had us operational in a week. We would never be at the point we are now if it weren’t for Vue. I’m 100% sure of that.

### The Future of Vue.js

From Evan You, Creator of Vue.js.

#### Sustainability

As a project, Vue.js has come a long way to become what it is today. It has grown from a small experiment into a mature framework that is used by hundreds of thousands of developers all over the world. It has also grown from “yet an- other side project” into an ecosystem with over 300 contributors across the vuejs organization, and maintained by a core team of over 20 active members across the globe. Core team members have taken up responsibilities such as core library maintenance, documentation, community engagement, and major new features such as type declara- tion improvements and test utilities. Saying that Vue is a “one-man proj- ect” is no longer accurate and would be disrespectful to all the amazing contributions from the team and the community.

Financially, the Patreon campaign has been receiving stable recurring pledges since February 2016, which has allowed me to commit to full- time work on the project for over one and a half years now. In addition, the recently started OpenCollective campaign, which aims at providing financial support to community initiatives, has received over $11,000 in annual budget in only two weeks and continues to grow. More importantly, these open financial contribution channels mean that your company can actively help ensure the sustainability of the project by becoming a sponsor.

Today I am confident to say that as an open source project, Vue.js has surpassed the critical mass and the project’s survival is no longer a concern for anyone considering adopting the project.

#### Stability

The frontend landscape moves fast and we understand how frustrating constant breaking changes can be. That is why we take stability very seriously. Looking at the project’s history on GitHub, you will see a rock solid track record of consistent releases of new features and improve- ments, prompt bug fixes, and a meticulous standard for code quality(yes, we maintain 100% test coverage).

All Vue.js package releases adhere to semantic versioning and we try our best to communicate any potential required actions ahead of time. 1.0 was released in October of 2015 and didn’t go through a single breaking change in the public API until 2.0 was released almost a year later. Before the release of 2.0, we conducted open design discussions and released multiple alpha/beta/RC releases to ensure the stability of the final release. We worked hard to retain API similarity with 1.0 and provided comprehensive guidance and tooling for the upgrade. Today, 2.0 has been out for over a year, used widely in production all over the world, and we don’t see a need for major breaking API changes in the foreseeable future. It is our commitment to evolve the framework with minimal churn for the users.

#### Continuous Evolution

Of course, we are not going to sit on what we have done up until today.
We have many ideas in the roadmap that we plan to explore and implement in the coming years, and I will divide them into three categories:

##### Near-term improvements

These are new features/improvements that will be continuously delivered in 2.x minor releases. They can come from feature requests, inspirations from the broader web dev community, and use cases we have encountered ourselves in actual development.

##### Mid-term improvements

There are new JavaScript language features (e.g. ES2015 Proxy, Promises) that may simplify or improve the current API, but are currently not suitable for the main branch due to having to support IE9. We plan to start taking advantage of these features in a parallel branch which requires latest evergreen browsers.

##### Long-term improvements

We are also keeping an eye on emerging standards such as ES class syntax improvements (class fields and decorators), Web Components (custom elements & HTML modules) and Web Assembly. We have already started experimenting with some of them, and will definitely leverage them to further improve Vue’s development experience and performance as they mature in terms of browser adoption.

#### Long-Term Vision

Many people have asked me why I started working on Vue.js. To be honest, the original goal was to “scratch my own itch,” to create a frontend library that I would enjoy using myself. As Vue got adopted by more and more users along this journey, I received many messages from users telling me that Vue has made their work much more en- joyable, so it seems my preference happens to align with that of many fellow Web developers. Today, I envision Vue’s goal to be helping more developers enjoy building apps on the Web. I believe that happier developers are more productive, and ultimately create more value for everyone. The goal entails delivering a framework that is approachable, intuitive, and at the same time solid, powerful, and scalable. I believe we are on the right track, but there is also a lot more we can do, espe- cially with the Web platform evolving faster than ever before.

We are excited for what’s yet to come.
